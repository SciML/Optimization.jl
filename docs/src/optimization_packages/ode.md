# OptimizationODE.jl

**OptimizationODE.jl** provides ODE-based optimization methods as a solver plugin for [SciML's Optimization.jl](https://github.com/SciML/Optimization.jl). It wraps various ODE solvers to perform gradient-based optimization using continuous-time dynamics.

## Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="OptimizationODE.jl")
```

## Usage

```julia
using OptimizationODE, Optimization, ADTypes, SciMLBase

function f(x, p)
    return sum(abs2, x)
end

function g!(g, x, p)
    @. g = 2 * x
end

x0 = [2.0, -3.0]
p = []

f_manual = OptimizationFunction(f, SciMLBase.NoAD(); grad = g!)
prob_manual = OptimizationProblem(f_manual, x0)

opt = ODEGradientDescent(dt=0.01)
sol = solve(prob_manual, opt; maxiters=50_000)

@show sol.u
@show sol.objective
```

## Available Optimizers

All provided optimizers are **gradient-based local optimizers** that solve optimization problems by integrating gradient-based ODEs to convergence:

* `ODEGradientDescent(dt=...)` — performs basic gradient descent using the explicit Euler method. This is a simple and efficient method suitable for small-scale or well-conditioned problems.

* `RKChebyshevDescent()` — uses the ROCK2 solver, a stabilized explicit Runge-Kutta method suitable for stiff problems. It allows larger step sizes while maintaining stability.

* `RKAccelerated()` — leverages the Tsit5 method, a 5th-order Runge-Kutta solver that achieves faster convergence for smooth problems by improving integration accuracy.

* `HighOrderDescent()` — applies Vern7, a high-order (7th-order) explicit Runge-Kutta method for even more accurate integration. This can be beneficial for problems requiring high precision.

You can also define a custom optimizer using the generic `ODEOptimizer(solver; dt=nothing)` constructor by supplying any ODE solver supported by [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/ode_solve/).

## Interface Details

All optimizers require gradient information (either via automatic differentiation or manually provided `grad!`). The optimization is performed by integrating the ODE defined by the negative gradient until a steady state is reached.

### Keyword Arguments

* `dt` — time step size (only for `ODEGradientDescent`).
* `maxiters` — maximum number of ODE steps.
* `callback` — function to observe progress.
* `progress=true` — enables live progress display.
