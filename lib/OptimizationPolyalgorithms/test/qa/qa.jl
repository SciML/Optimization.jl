# ExplicitImports findings, all tracked against SciML/Optimization.jl:
#  * no_implicit_imports broken: the module relies on `@reexport`/`using`
#    module names (SciMLBase/OptimizationBase/Reexport/...) that cannot be made
#    explicit without restructuring.
#  * the ignored *_are_public / *_via_owners names are owned by SciMLBase,
#    OptimizationBase, the backend, or Base and are not (yet) declared public;
#    the proper fix is upstream `public` declarations, not a local change.
